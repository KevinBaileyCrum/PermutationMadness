along with other users' solutions (be warned for they are vastly inferior to mine)


a list of programs in their initial order

First you will be given a string of characters, each character is an individual program

On the next line you will get a list of moves split by ,

The moves work as following:

Spin is given as SN where N is a positive integer. This moves N programs from the right up front, keeping their order

Exchange is given as xA/B where A and B are the positions of two programs that will swap positions

Partner is given as pA/B where A and B refer to the original positions of the programs and swaps them whereever they currently are
